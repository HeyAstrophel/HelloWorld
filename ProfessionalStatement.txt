My name is Joshua Ford, and I believe that in the age of information, the need to secure the data of organizations and individuals is at an all time high. I am excited to join the battle against attackers that are seeking to take advantage of that data.

Growing up with technology, I have always been interested in learning methods of gaining administrator access, rooting (root access), and bypassing normally restricted permissions on systems.

Through acquiring cybersecurity certifications, I can continue to cultivate my skillset and use it to help people stay secure, as well as advance my career in the industry.

My current goals are to learn how to manage risks that take place in the field (Cybersecurity Analyst), defend an entity against data breaches by threat actors (SOC Analyst), and target vulnerabilities to bring awareness to organizations (Penetration Testing).
